## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/GitHub
   git clone <repository-url> "Botable usb"
   cd "Botable usb"
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x bootable_usb_creator.py
   ```

3. **Verify dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 bootable_usb_creator.py
   ```
   The application will check for missing dependencies on startup.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Launch the application:**
   ```bash
   python3 bootable_usb_creator.py
   ```

2. **Select ISO file:**
   - Click "Browse..." to select your Windows 10/11 or other OS ISO file

3. **Select USB device:**
   - The application automatically detects USB devices
   - Click "Refresh" to rescan for devices
   - Select your target USB drive from the dropdown

4. **Configure settings:**
   - **Boot Mode**: Choose UEFI (modern) or Legacy BIOS (older systems)
   - **Partition Scheme**: GPT (recommended for UEFI) or MBR (for Legacy BIOS)
   - **File System**: FAT32 (universal), NTFS (Windows), or exFAT (large files)
   - **Volume Label**: Custom name for your USB drive

5. **Create bootable USB:**
   - Click "Create Bootable USB"
   - Confirm the warning prompt
   - Wait for the process to complete

### Command Line Alternative

For advanced users who prefer command-line tools, you can also use `dd` directly:

```bash
# WARNING: This will erase all data on the USB drive!
sudo dd if=/path/to/your.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

Replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual USB device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`).

## Configuration Options

### Boot Modes

- **UEFI**: Modern boot mode, recommended for newer computers (2012+)
  - Faster boot times
  - Supports GPT partition tables
  - Required for Secure Boot

- **Legacy BIOS**: Traditional boot mode for older computers
  - Compatible with older hardware
  - Uses MBR partition tables
  - Requires GRUB bootloader installation

### Partition Schemes

- **GPT (GUID Partition Table)**:
  - Modern standard
  - Required for UEFI boot
  - Supports drives larger than 2TB
  - More reliable

- **MBR (Master Boot Record)**:
  - Legacy standard
  - Required for Legacy BIOS boot
  - Limited to 2TB drives
  - Maximum 4 primary partitions

### File Systems

- **FAT32**:
  - Universal compatibility
  - Works with UEFI and BIOS
  - File size limit: 4GB
  - Recommended for most use cases

- **NTFS**:
  - Windows native file system
  - No file size limits
  - May have compatibility issues with UEFI
  - Requires ntfs-3g package

- **exFAT**:
  - Modern file system
  - No file size limits
  - Good compatibility
  - Requires exfat-utils package

## Creating Windows 10/11 Bootable USB

### For Modern Computers (UEFI)

1. Download Windows 10/11 ISO from Microsoft
2. Select the ISO in the application
3. Configure:
   - Boot Mode: **UEFI**
   - Partition Scheme: **GPT**
   - File System: **FAT32** (recommended) or **NTFS**
4. Create bootable USB

### For Older Computers (Legacy BIOS)

1. Download Windows 10/11 ISO from Microsoft
2. Select the ISO in the application
3. Configure:
   - Boot Mode: **Legacy BIOS**
   - Partition Scheme: **MBR**
   - File System: **FAT32** or **NTFS**
4. Create bootable USB

## Troubleshooting

### USB Device Not Detected

- Ensure the USB drive is properly connected
- Click the "Refresh" button
- Try a different USB port
- Check if the device is mounted: `lsblk`

### Permission Denied Errors

- The application requires sudo privileges
- You will be prompted for your password
- Ensure your user is in the `sudo` group

### ISO File Not Bootable

- Verify the ISO file is not corrupted (check MD5/SHA256)
- Ensure you downloaded the correct ISO for your target system
- Try a different boot mode (UEFI vs Legacy BIOS)

### GRUB Installation Failed

- This is a warning, not an error
- The USB may still be bootable
- Install grub2-common package for full support

### Boot Fails on Target Computer

- Check BIOS/UEFI settings on the target computer
- Ensure boot mode matches (UEFI vs Legacy)
- Disable Secure Boot if using Legacy BIOS mode
- Try changing the boot order in BIOS

### Large ISO Files (>4GB) with FAT32

- FAT32 has a 4GB file size limit
- If your ISO contains files larger than 4GB:
  - Use NTFS file system instead
  - Or use exFAT if supported

A: This tool is designed for Windows and Linux ISOs. macOS requires special handling and is not currently supported.

**Q: Will this work on Windows or macOS host systems?**
A: No, this is a Linux-only tool. For Windows, use Rufus. For macOS, use balenaEtcher or dd.

**Q: How long does it take to create a bootable USB?**
A: Typically 5-15 minutes depending on ISO size and USB speed. Windows 11 ISOs are around 5GB.

**Q: Can I use the USB drive for storage after?**
A: Yes, you can reformat it. However, while it's bootable, it's dedicated to that purpose.

**Q: Is this safe to use?**
A: Yes, but always double-check the selected device before confirming. The tool includes multiple safety prompts.
